## setup instructions (API)
First al all we have to clone this repo and cd in to the API project

Then we have to create a .env file
```
touch .env
```

```

To set up the server with a deamon:
```
npm run dev

npm start 
```
to run the index file, so taht we can se the API is running in the port 8080 in localhost
